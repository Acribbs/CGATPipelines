"""
pipeline_peakcalling.py - Produce Peaklist from Bam Files
===================================================

:Author: Katy Brown & Charlie George
:Release: $Id$
:Date: |today|
:Tags: Python


Overview
========

The aim of this pipeline is to create peaklists in :term:`bed` files from
aligned reads in :term:`bam` files that can then be taken on to downstream
analysis (e.g. motif identification, quantification of peaks etc.). Pipeline
also and generates QC  statistics that will inform you about the quality of
the peaksets generated.

Functionality
-------------

- Takes Paired-end or single end :term:`Bam` files you want to call peaks in
  (e.g. ChIP-Seq or ATAC-Seq samples and their appropriate 'input' controls).
- Runs peakcallers
- Runs ChIPQC R package for QC statistics
- Produces peak lists in bed files to takeforward for downstream analysis.


    Optional functions:
    -------------------
    - Filter Bam files to remove:
            - Duplicates
            - Secondary alignments
            - Unpaired reads for paired-end files
            - Reads overlapping 'blacklisted' regions
            - Mapping quality (MAPQ) score
    - Pool input files for peakcalling to give better peakcalling
      when inputs have poor coverage or lack of sequening depth
    - Perform Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) analysis (described
      further below) to get a consensus list of 'highly reproducible peaks'
      and assess replicate quaility.


NOTE: WARNINGS!!!!
------------------

1. IDR analysis may not be approprate for all type of peak file - It works
best with transcription factor CHIPs or methodologies producing 'narrow peaks'
or peaks with well defined boundaries.

'BroadPeak' IDR (e.g. for widespread histone marks such as H3K27ac)
might not work because peak boundary's are harder to define and thus may
not be so reproducible between replicates


2. Always check your output from this pipeline in a genome browser to check
peaks are being called suffiently!

3. This pipeline references ChIP bams throughout in the code -this
referencces the immunoprecipitated (IP) sample from a ChIP experiment
(i.e. the file you want to find peaks in), Input bams refer to the
bams of the input control samples that are used for background
normalisation in peak calling. Although we refer to ChIP bams
this is only nomenclature and you could just as easily use
an ATAC-Seq bam file or other bam file in which you are looking for
peaks

4) Whilst you can call peaks with as many peakcallers that are implemented in
the pipeline, only the results from one peakcaller can be taken forward for IDR
analysis. If you want to run IDR analysis on the output of multiple peakcallers
you will need first run IDR with one peakcaller then clone the pipeline, modify
pipeline.ini file and delete the appripriate files to rerun the IDR analysis on
the output from a different peakcaller. Bewarned that IDR analysis generates
a large number of peakfiles and it is best to decide on your prefered peakcaller
before running the IDR analysis.


References
==========

This pipeline follows closely the ENCODE3 version 1 peakprocessing pipeline
described by Anshul Kundaje's group:

(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lG_Rd7fnYgRpSIqrIfuVlAz2dW1VaSQThzk836Db99c/edit#heading=h.9ecc41kilcvq)

and the open source AQUAS TF ChIP-Seq pipeline implemented by the Kundaje group
https://github.com/kundajelab/TF_chipseq_pipeline


IDR analysis workflow is described here
    * (https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/idr)

for troubleshooting/discussion of the IDR workflow see and extra documentation

IDR Analysis
============

IDR analysis is used to:
    * Give an indication of how reproducible the peaks that are produced by the
      peakcallers are within a single sample
    * Give an indication of how reproducible the peaks that are produced by the
      peakcallers are within biological replicates
    * produce a `conservative` peak list of highly reproducible peaks that
      can be taken forward to downstream analysis
    * produce an `oracle` peakset of the a large number of mostly reproducible
      peaks that can be taken forward to downstream analysis
    * sometimes the `conserative` and the `oracle` peakset will be the same
      list.
    * for further information on IDR analysis see the links above

Important notes:
IDR analysis requires peaks are called with a relaxed threshold to generate
a peaklist that contains (ideally) > 120,000 peaks that will contain
reproducible or 'true' peaks along with alot of irreproduible 'false' peaks.

Requirements
============

The pipeline requires the results from
:doc:`pipeline_annotations`. Set the configuration variable
:py:data:`annotations_database` and :py:data:`annotations_dir`.

On top of the default CGAT setup, the pipeline requires the following
software to be in the path:

Usage
=====

See :ref:`PipelineSettingUp` and :ref:`PipelineRunning` on general
information how to use CGAT pipelines.

Configuration
-------------

What is this section??

IDR

Input
-----

Sample_bam = bam file you want to call peaks on

Input_bam = control file used as background reference in peakcalling
(e.g. input file for ChIP-seq)

Pipeline.ini = File containing paramaters and options for
running the pipeline

Desgin.tsv = Design file based on design file for R package Diff Bind
Has the following collumns:


Pipeline output
===============

The aim of this pipeline is to output a list of peaks that
can be used for further downstream analysis.

The pipeline generates several new directories containing
output files - these can roughly be grouped into XXX main
stages of the pipeline

1) Bam file preparation
    --------------------
    - filtered_bams.dir:
    Contains bams files (and thier indexes)
    that have been filtered according to pipeline.ini and a number
    of log files relating to the number of reads that have been
    filtered out for each reason. Also contains file with the
    frequency of fragment lengths (the 3' end to 5'end of sequenced)
    for paired-end samples.


    IDR.dir:
    Directory conatining the output files from IDR analysis
    These include the lists of reproducible peaks and stats and
    QC tables summarising the output of the IDR analysis

    IDR_inputs.dir
    This directory contains the files that are

IDR_inputs.dir

macs2.dir/

peakcalling_bams.dir/

peaks_for_IDR.dir/

pooled_bams.dir/
Peaksets:

Conservative Peakset = Only obtained if IDR analysis run
IDR analysis
This analysis does a comparision on a pair of peak files to

Tables
Contained in the database are several tables used for QC and
analysis
