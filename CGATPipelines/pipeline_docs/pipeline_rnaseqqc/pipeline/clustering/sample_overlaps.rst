   Sample Overlap Heatmap.


Here, we look at the overlap between the top 1000 most highly
expressed genes in each sample

About this section
==================

Aims
----
The overlaps of sample expression highlights the common overlapping
genes found between each of the samples. The aim of this page is to
identify any outliers within your data obvious and check samples from the
same conditions are more similar than between conditions.


Inputs
------
A table of expression values in TPM for each transcript that are
generated by sailfish and stored in the 'transcript_quanitification'
table within the pipeline csvdb database

Outputs
-------
A heatmap representing the overlapping (common) genes between samples with a TPM above a
TPM threshold of >= 100. 

How the results are generated
-----------------------------

   1. Distinct genes and their TPM values >= 100 are extracted from the
      database and a dataframe of the output is created
   2. An all-vs-all comparison of the samples is perfomed and the
      overlapping samples are returned to the tracker for rendering
      into a heatmap
